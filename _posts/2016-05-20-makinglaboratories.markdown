<p>Making Laboratories is a two-day pre-conference workshop (22-23 May 2016) organized in conjunction with the COOP Conference 2016, 12th International Conference on the Design of Cooperative Systems (25-27 May 2016). The 2016 edition is curated and introduced by the University of Trento while the Making Laboratories pre-conference workshop is hosted by the MUSE FabLab, located within the MUSE Science Museum, in Trento as well.

The Making Laboratories is a two day seminar focusing on the topic of **Workshopology**. In it, experts from different fields of research and practice – from academia to fablabs – will team up in order to co-create both guidelines for workshops and physical prototypes of educational activities, collaboratively discussed, designed and prototyped in the FabLab facility. </p>
